in this program i used jdbc my sql and java
to make connection between java to my sql we have to first 
downlod the jar file of my-sql according to version 

then flow -right-click ->build path -configure build path->in libraries
->add external jar


so in this program you are also need mysql 
i have create database by the name of db1;
and create the table
:-create table test(emp_name varchar(200),emp_age int);
